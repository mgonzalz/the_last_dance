Implement two vehicle classes:
Car:
The constructor for Car must take two arguments.â€¨The first of them is its maximum speed, and the second one is a string that denotes the units in which the speed is given: either "km/h" or "mph".
The class must be implemented to return a string based on the arguments. For example, if caris an object of class Car with a maximum speed of 120, and the unit is "km/h", then printing car prints the following string: "Car with the maximum speed of 120 km/h", without quotes. If the maximum speed is 94 and the unit is "mph", then printing car prints in the following string: "Car with the maximum speed of 94 mph", without quotes.
Boat:
The constructor for Boat must take a single argument denoting its maximum speed in knots.
The class must be implemented to return a string based on the argument. For example, if boatis an object of class Boat with a maximum speed of 82. then printing boat prints the following string: "Boat with the maximum speed of 82 knots", without quotes.
